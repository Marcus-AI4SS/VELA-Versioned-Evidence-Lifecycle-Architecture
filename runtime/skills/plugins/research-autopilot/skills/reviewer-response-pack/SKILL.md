# Reviewer Response Pack



Use this skill after peer-review feedback arrives. It is not a generic paper review skill. Its job is to preserve each editor/reviewer concern, map it to real manuscript action or unresolved author input, and produce an auditable response package.



## Required Contract



Before drafting, read:



- `<VELA_RUNTIME_ROOT>\skills\catalog\peer_review_workflow.json`

- `<VELA_RUNTIME_ROOT>\skills\catalog\publication_style_rules.json`

- `<VELA_RUNTIME_ROOT>\skills\catalog\writing_quality_rules.json`



Use the `revision_response_review` mode in `peer_review_workflow.json`.



## Input Readiness



Accepted inputs:



- editor decision letter

- reviewer comments

- response draft

- revised manuscript

- tracked-change summary

- author notes

- figure/table/supplement change list

- target journal or submission system constraints



If reviewer boundaries, comment segmentation, or manuscript version is unclear, flag it. Do not invent reviewer structure.



## Workflow



1. Identify mode:

   - `triage-only`: classify comments and blockers

   - `draft`: build response letter from supplied facts

   - `audit`: check an existing response draft

   - `revise`: revise the response package

   - `verification-review`: verify whether claimed changes actually appear in the revised manuscript

2. Extract editor instructions first and assign IDs such as `E.1`; then split reviewer comments as `R1.1`, `R1.2`, `R2.1`.

3. Preserve each comment's meaning before responding.

4. Classify each item:

   - severity: `minor`, `major`, `blocking`, `unclear`

   - category: theory, literature, method, identification, measurement, evidence, statistics, citation, figure/table, reproducibility, ethics, writing, scope

   - risk: low, medium, high, blocking

5. Map each item to an action:

   - `ACCEPT_TEXT`

   - `ACCEPT_ANALYSIS`

   - `ACCEPT_FIGURE_TABLE`

   - `CLARIFY_EXISTING`

   - `ADD_CITATION_VERIFIED`

   - `SOFTEN_CLAIM`

   - `PARTIAL`

   - `DISAGREE_WITH_EVIDENCE`

   - `OUT_OF_SCOPE`

   - `AUTHOR_INPUT_NEEDED`

   - `BLOCKING`

6. Build the response strategy summary before drafting prose.

7. Draft point-by-point responses only for items with enough facts.

8. For every claimed change, include manuscript location, figure/table/supplement location, citation evidence, or an explicit placeholder.

9. Run verification:

   - every comment answered or explicitly unresolved

   - every "we have..." statement tied to real evidence

   - no invented line numbers, analyses, citations, figures, data, or appendices

   - disagreement first acknowledges the concern

   - limitations are not hidden



## Re-Review Verification



When the user asks whether revisions addressed comments, produce a verification matrix:



| ID | Original comment | Author claim | Claimed location | Verified status | Residual issue | Required next action |

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|



Use these statuses:



- `FULLY_ADDRESSED`

- `PARTIALLY_ADDRESSED`

- `NOT_ADDRESSED`

- `MADE_WORSE`

- `CANNOT_VERIFY`



If author notes say only "已修改" or "addressed as suggested", mark `CANNOT_VERIFY` until the real location and change are supplied.

## Red Lines



- Do not ignore any reviewer comment.

- Do not change the meaning of a reviewer comment.

- Do not claim a revision was made unless the user supplied it or it is visible in the revised manuscript.

- Do not invent line numbers, page numbers, figure panels, citations, statistical results, sample sizes, data availability, or supplementary materials.

- Do not cite time, money, or convenience as the main reason for not doing requested work.

- Do not draft around missing ethics, compliance, or data-integrity requirements.

- Do not let response writing bypass `citation-verifier`, `writing-reference-capture`, or the peer-review protocol gate.
